Mechanical:
Internal 3:1 planetary gear box must be finished by end of September. 


Elecrtrical:
Design for internal power distribution will begin once the internal devices have been selcted. This should begin around  middle to late October. 


Computer:
Need program for controlling all 4 motor independantly completed by the end of septmeber


Updates:


9/8/2025 \
-Current MOtors are two week and fragile. 
-Contacting Suppliers for Hallow Shaft pancake motors with around ~ 2.0kgf-cm

9/15/2025
-New motors have been found. We need to aquire funding and setup a fedex shipping account.

General updates for Sepetember and October:
-Motors aquired
-Basic arduino code for various peripherals and motor control completed
-First Wheel Designs Printed

Gener updated for November:
-Arduino groundwork complete for bluetooth controller motor control
-Prototype wheel design finalized

MAIN END OF SD1 UPDATE (12/3/2025):
The prototype was not finished due to the prints not being finshed before end of semester but all designs and electronics for a basic prototype were complete. The Arduino ESP32 was able to control the motors individually with a bluetooth controller but machine vision is on hold for the time being due to problems with the devices used (Raspberry Pi is too slow, Coral TPU documents were removed by google).

SD2 Start:
1/21/2026
-Continue printing various wheel and gear prototypes
-Computer engineers move onto lidar SLAM simulation
-Started prototype electrical distrobution board design

1/28/2026
-Electrical board prototype completed.
